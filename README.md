# finX

A new Flutter project.

FinX is a personal treasurer app. A system that analyzes interest rates, fees and transactions associated with individual / company accounts, and recommends alternative higher yield, no-fee deposit instruments that at least offset the inflation rate, to prevent the deterioration of wealth.

Problem: Over the last ten years the inflation rate was on average 2%, while most banks offered close to 0% interest on deposits, in addition to charging high maintenance fees, which translates into 20% loss of purchasing power.

Customers: There are 1 billion deposit accounts, which are associated with at least 300 million unique customers that have in excess of 13 trillion US dollars in deposits across 5.000 banks in the USA.
